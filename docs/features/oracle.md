# Oracle

## Introduction

The module combines `service` to achieve decentralized injection from trusted Oracles such as `Chainlink` to IRISHub Oracle. Each data collection task is called a feed, and its underlying implementation depends on the `service` module. Feed life cycle
It is basically the same as the `Service` RequestContext (paused, running), and is used to store off-chain data on the chain through Oracle nodes. In addition, you can only operate `Feed` through your Profiler account, and you cannot delete it. You can only pause the feed. Including the following operationsï¼š

- Create Feed
- Start Feed
- Pause Feed
- Edit Feed

In addition to collecting data by creating a feed, the module also presets some aggregation functions, such as `avg`, `max`, `min`, etc., to process the collected data to meet various scenarios. The data collected by each `Feed` can only save the most recent 100 entries, and the rest will be deleted.

## Process

The bottom layer of the module depends on the `service` module, so the premise of using this module is to execute the relevant functions of `Service`

- Create `Service` definition
- Bind `Service`

Specific instructions[service](./service.md). After completing the `service` related operations, start the `Oracle` process:

**1. Create Feed**

```bash
iris tx oracle create \
    --feed-name="test-feed" \
    --latest-history=10 \
    --service-name="test-service" \
    --input={request-data} \
    --providers="faa1hp29kuh22vpjjlnctmyml5s75evsnsd8r4x0mm,faa15rurzhkemsgfm42dnwhafjdv5s8e2pce0ku8ya" \
    --service-fee-cap=1iris \
    --timeout=2 \
    --frequency=10 \
    --threshold=1 \
    --aggregate-func="avg" \
    --value-json-path="high" \
    --chain-id="irishub-test" \
    --from=node0 \
    --fees=0.3iris \
    --broadcast-mode=block
```

**2. Start Feed**

After the `Feed` is created, the collection task is in the `paused` state, and no request is made to the service provider. You can start the scheduled task of the feed through `start`.

```bash
iris tx oracle start test-feed \
    --chain-id="irishub-test" \
    --from=node0 \
    --fees=0.3iris \
    --broadcast-mode=block
```

**3. Pause Feed**

Since `Feed` cannot be deleted once it is created, it will consume the balance of the owner's account until the balance is exhausted, and `Feed` will enter the `paused` state. To be able to pause the feed manually, you can use the pause command

```bash
iris tx oracle pause test-feed \
    --chain-id="irishub-test" \
    --from=node0 \
    --fees=0.3iris \
    --broadcast-mode=block
```

**4. Edit Feed**

You can use the edit command to edit an existing feed to change the data collection behavior of the feed.

```bash
iris tx oracle edit test-feed \
    --latest-history=5 \
    --providers="faa1r3tyupskwlh07dmhjw70frxzaaaufta37y25yr,faa1ydahnhrhkjh9j9u0jn8p3s272l0ecqj40vra8h" \
    --service-fee-cap=1iris \
    --timeout=6 \
    --threshold=5 \
    --chain-id="irishub-test" \
    --from=node0 \
    --fees=0.3iris \
    --broadcast-mode=block
```

Note that if the `latest-history` at the time of creation is greater than the currently modified value, the oracle module will delete the extra data.
